When the upstream git repo is on the other side of a low-bandwidth
connection, it may be desirable to mirror it just once, and configure
slaves to fetch from that repo during a build.

In the config.yaml file (see the sample 'config.yaml.sample'),
configure the upstream repo in the change source's 'repourl'
parameter.  In the example, the 'glo-ubc3' change source is set to
poll the linuxcnc.org git server.  Choose a 'workdir' suitable for
access by the web server.  By default, 'buildmaster' creates the repo
without read permission for the others.  [FIXME:  how can this be
changed in buildbot?]

Because apache doesn't understand git, auxiliary files must be
generated to help clients discover references.  In the 'workdir', run:

    su -s /bin/bash buildbot -c 'git update-server-info'

The local build master runs a web server exposing the local
repo.  The below Apache configuration follows the sample config, where
the change source 'workdir' is /home/buildbot/git-repos:

Alias /git /home/buildbot/git-repos
<Directory /home/buildbot/git-repos>
        Options Indexes
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>

In the build factory configuration, add a step to fetch from the above
repo.  In the example, the 'init' step fetches from the build master
at the URI directory configured in the 'Alias' above.
