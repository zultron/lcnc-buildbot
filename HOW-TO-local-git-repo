When the upstream git repo is on the other side of a low-bandwidth
connection, it may be desirable to mirror it just once, and configure
slaves to fetch from that repo during a build.

In the config.yaml file (see the sample 'config.yaml.sample'),
configure the upstream repo in the change source's 'repourl'
parameter.  In the example, the 'glo-ubc3' change source is set to
poll the linuxcnc.org git server.  Choose a 'workdir' suitable for
access by the web server.

By default, 'buildmaster' creates the repo without read permission for
the others.  A suitable umask must be set so that apache has read
access to the git repo, maybe 022.  For pre-0.8.8, set the 'umask'
parameter in the 'global' setting of config.yaml, as in the sample
file.  For 0.8.8 on, set it on the provided line in buildbot.tac.

In 0.8.8, the build master fetches branches into
'buildbot/<giturl>/<branch>' rather than 'refs/heads/<branch>'.  I
don't know how to deal with this yet.

Because apache doesn't understand git, auxiliary files must be
generated to help clients discover references.  See the 'git-web' step
in the sample config, which runs 'git update-server-info' on the build
master before each new build.

The local build master runs a web server exposing the local
repo.  The below Apache configuration follows the sample config, where
the change source 'workdir' is /home/buildbot/git-repos:

Alias /git /home/buildbot/git-repos
<Directory /home/buildbot/git-repos>
        Options Indexes
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>

In the build factory configuration, add a step to fetch from the above
repo.  In the example, the 'init' step fetches from the build master
at the URI directory configured in the 'Alias' above.
